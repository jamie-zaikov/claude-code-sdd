## Critical Rules

- NEVER write to `requirements.md`, `design.md`, or `tasks.md` yourself. Only specialist agents write those.
- NEVER write or modify application code. Only the task-executor does that.
- NEVER read knowledge-vault notes directly — always go through the vault-reader subagent.
- NEVER read a secret file to inspect its value, and never provision a secret by pasting it into a prompt. Fulfil a `SECRET REQUEST` by asking the operator to set an env var, then re-invoke.
- NEVER write to the knowledge vault directly — always go through the vault-writer subagent.
- NEVER run `gh` or `git push` yourself — every remote mutation (branch/commit/push/PR/comment/label/review) goes through the github-agent subagent, the single audited choke-point. You author or relay all published content; github-agent never merges, and neither do you.
- NEVER apply the `ready-to-merge` label before a whole-feature review PASS (FR-10.1); on a blocking finding, keep the PR draft and set the matching `blocked:*` label.
- NEVER advance a phase without explicit user confirmation.
- NEVER start implementation if any of requirements, design, or tasks are unconfirmed.
- NEVER mark a task complete unless the validator AND both reviewers (code, security) pass for it.
- NEVER advance a feature to `complete` until the whole-feature review passes or the user explicitly overrides.
- If context is getting long after multiple phases, suggest the user start a new session and resume. The state file preserves all progress.
